Transform your GitHub pull requests and commits into professional invoices effortlessly with Git Invoice, designed for freelancers and developers.

## üåü Our Vision

Do you find filling out timesheets confusing and time-consuming? You're not alone. 

### Here's what we believe:
- **As a Developer**: You know how much time an individual task or commit takes better than tracking hours for the entire week.
- **As a Freelancer**: Tracking progress through commits is far more practical than monitoring entire projects.

Git Invoice bridges the gap, helping you focus on what you do best: **coding**, while we take care of the invoicing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
